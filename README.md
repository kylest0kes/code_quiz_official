In theis application, we have a basic coding bootcamp quiz where we have a randomly shuffled order of quiz questions and you are given 4 possible answers to choose from.  Once a answer is selected, the user is alerted if there answer is correct or wrong, then moves to the next question.  Upon selecting an answer, the user is either awarded an additional 10 seconds to there timer for a correct answer, or they are penalized 10 seconds for a wrong answer. At the end of the quiz the user is notified of their score and it is stored into local sotrage, anduser is taken to the high score page.
